                              Testing Loan Application Process

1>Opening application for manual testing 

 The test data is provided in an Excel sheet. We initiate manual testing to observe the software's behavior and evaluate the time required for this process.

1.1) Sequentially, we utilize data from the Excel sheet to assess the software's behavior through manual testing.
     In a positive scenario,LoanGranted in test data is 'yes' results in the message "Congratulations! You have been approved for a loan.
     
1.2) In the negative scenario, an empty email field in test data prompts the message "Sorry, at this time you have not been approved for a loan.

1.3) Conversely, another negative scenario emerges when the provided age is less than 18, leading to the message "Loan is not approved.

These tests encompass both positive and negative scenarios to comprehensively evaluate the software's functionality.

1.4) The manual testing process may become time-consuming when dealing with a vast amount of data. Moreover, the probability of human error is higher.



 Not it's time for Automation testing through uipath testsuite The bot starts execution process.


2> We're now initiating automation software testing to observe the software's behavior and assess the time needed for this process.

2.1) Sequentially, we're using test data from the Excel sheet to evaluate the software's behavior through automation testing.
     In a positive scenario,LoanGranted in test data is 'yes' successful test data results the message "Congratulations! You have been approved for a loan.

2.2) In the negative scenario, an empty email field in test data triggers the message "Sorry, at this time you have not been approved for a loan.

2.3) Conversely, encountering an age less than 18 leads to the message "Loan is not approved.

These tests cover both positive and negative scenarios, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the software's functionality.

2.4) Automation testing significantly reduces the time required, even when handling extensive datasets.
